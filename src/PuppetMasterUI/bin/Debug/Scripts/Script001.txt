% Contacts the Pup- petMaster at the PUPPETMASTER-URL to 
% creates a worker process with an identifier <ID> that exposes 
% its services at <SERVICE-URL>. If an <ENTRY-URL> is provided, 
% the new worker should notify the set of existing workers that 
% it has started by calling the worker listening at <ENTRY-URL>. 
% Since this command can be used to create local or remote workers, 
% it will be simpler to implement it as a call to the local (or remote) 
% Puppet- Master’s job creation service.

WORKER <ID> <PUPPETMASTER-URL> <SERVICE-URL> <ENTRY-URL>

%% 
% Creates an application on the local node. The application submits a job 
% to the PADIMapNoReduce platform by system by contacting the worker at <ENTRY-URL>. 
% The job is defined by the following parameters:
% – <FILE> is the path to the input file. The file will be subdivided into <S> splits 
%   across the machines in W.
% – <OUTPUT> is the path to an output directory on the local filesystem of the application, 
%   which will store one output file for each split of the input file name “S1.out”, “S2.out”, . . ., “S.out”.
% – <S>, i.e. the number of splits of the input file, which corresponds to the total 
%   number of worker tasks to be executed.
% – The name of the class implementing the IMap interface.

% Makes the PuppetMaster stop the execution of commands of the script

WAIT <SECS>

%%
% Makes all workers and job trackers of the PADIMapNoReduce system print their 
% current status. The report shall allow to determine the state of progress of each 
% map task at every node of the platform, as well as the current phase of execution 
% of the job (e.g., transfer of the input/output data, computing, etc.). 
% The status command should present brief information about the state of the 
% system (who is present, who is in charge of coordination, which nodes are presumed failed). 
% Status information can be printed on each nodes’ console and does not need to be 
% centralized at the PuppetMaster.
